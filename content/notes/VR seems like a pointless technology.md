I'm self conscious about making this one public. I feel passionately about this subject. I think my anger is misdirected (in some ways) because I haven't fully sorted out my feelings and thoughts. 

I know people who like and have worked on VR. I like and respect their feelings/work. I don't like how this entry puts me in a position of hostility toward them. I feel like I'm taking a more extreme position in this entry than my true feelings.

I hope that sharing writing I'm embarrassed of helps me continue sorting this out though.

I think VR is just kind of a fundamentally silly technology. I think it comes from a perspective on technology and gaming that I think is fundamentally dystopian. A focus on immersion seems more about a dream of selling ad space and escaping from a shitty reality.

I think there are some real utopian versions of this, like the Star Trek holodeck. I just don't think that's what we're going to get. I accept it as a good thing for folks who need the accessibility or want the escapism.

I'm just so against this increasing desire to capture more and more attention with technology. And that just seems to be the chief utility of VR related technology. The Apple Vision Pro and Meta Raybans version of VR/AR is the bullshit that seems like we'd end up with. 

I know there's some aspect of "old man yells at clouds" with this. I don't get it, whatever. It's not _just_ that I don't get the new technology. Technology I grew up with has lost its luster for me over time. Phones, social media, email, e-readers. Even streaming games and television and YouTube. 

I don't think its _just_ that I'm old. I think the idea of technological progress or just progress in general being a good thing is an idea I'm sick of. Sci fi was selling me that in my youth and it just feels so bullshit now.
