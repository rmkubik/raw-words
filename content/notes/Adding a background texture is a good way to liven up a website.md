Sites like [Subtle Patterns](https://www.subtlepatterns.com/) and [Transparent Textures](https://www.transparenttextures.com/) are a good source of mostly transparent patterns you can put on your sites.

These can be more of less subtle. But they all help make a site feel a bit more interesting to me than a full plain color background.
