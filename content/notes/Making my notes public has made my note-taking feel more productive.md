Making my notes public has made my note-taking feel more productive? Which is kinda cool and interesting.

Now that I'm publishing when I write notes it seems more like "work" instead of "metawork". The time I spent taking notes before didn't "produce" anything, but now it can.

Is this good? Bad? I'm not sure yet! It feels kinda good right now though.
