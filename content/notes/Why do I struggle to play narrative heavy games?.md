There are a bunch of narrative games that sound interesting but really struggle to get myself to play them. [[Citizen Sleeper]] and [[The Forgotten City]] are a couple in this category.

I played [[1000xResist]] recently with a friend and was able to get through that. I doubt I would have if I hadn't played with him though. I think I liked this game a lot? But also still feel sort of conflicted about it. The story is undeniably cool and interesting. 

[[Caves of Qud]] managed to get me invested for a while, but I lost steam there. This seems like an outlier of sorts because it has so much going on systemically.

I seem to REALLY struggle to play games without interesting systemic properties... That said, [[Citizen Sleeper]] is a counter here... That game has systems, but it didn't hook me either.

[[Elden Ring]], [[Outer Wilds]], [[Return of the Obra Dinn]], and [[The Case of the Golden Idol]] are all games that I think of as pretty narratively driven that worked well for me. Perhaps, the trick is that they're _not_ narratively driven though... They're driven by some other systemic properties and there's just also a compelling narrative alongside?
