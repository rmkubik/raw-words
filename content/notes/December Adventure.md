> The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is cool, but a lot, and not everyone’s jam.
> 
> The December Adventure is **low key**. The goal is to write a little bit of code every day in December.
> 
> …doesn’t even really have to be code! Let the December Adventure be for all kinds of creative pursuits.
> 
> In the words of [Ivan](https://ivanish.ca/),
> You should do a weird little extra thing every day. Something you don’t normally do. Maybe it’s creative. Maybe it’s coding. Doesn’t matter. But try to find a space moment in your day to do a weird little extra thing.

> Adventure logs
> 
> An adventure log is a handy way to map your journey — they’re not supposed to be a proof point of work or anything like that. My hope is that the adventure logs are a place to celebrate and share discoveries and other stuff found along the way.

A whole bunch of adventure logs are listed here:

## thoughts
Advent of Code has never really worked for me. I always like the idea of it and want it to fit into my life, but it just doesn't.

I love this idea of just doing a little something special over the holidays, but it doesn't need to be a whole big formal saga. This fits into my other goals and desires much better.
