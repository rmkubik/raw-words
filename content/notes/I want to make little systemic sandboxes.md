I want to make a bunch of lil thinky and tactics games!!! i keep starting and not finishing little grid tactical games. More stuff like submarine game, please!

The enemy and boss variety in [[Moonring]] is really inspirational for this. 

All of these little board games I play are inspiring for this. Like [[For Northwood]] and [[Solar Settlers]]. 

I think this ties handily into [[I want to ship ship ship]]!
