I want to publish more writing. I've gotten into a good habit of writing in my notes, but I never "finish" any of it for publication. I've decided to give up "finishing" notes and to publish them on my Quartz site, raw, instead.

This site is built with Quartz and shows all notes that I've tagged as `#public`. This is a pretty small subset of my notes right now, but I'm excited to see how it grows.
