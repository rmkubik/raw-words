I think [[Mosa Lina]] (still not 3D) is another great Cheese inspiration.

I love how much cheese there is in Elden Ring. How do you get that much delicious cheese in a turn based setting? Some amount of that roguelike feeling of hitting escape velocity is a feeling like this right? Or sort of a related feeling I guess... Not the exact same thing at all. I think Rail Heist (still real time though) does a really good job of adding systemic chaos and cheese and fun in a much more constrained environment than Elden Ring.
