## living
I'm living in Portland, OR. 

I've been playing Pickleball, Ping Pong, and Bouldering for exercise lately.
## reading
I'm currently reading [[Algorithms to Live By]], [[Tidy First?]], and [[Blindsight]]. A few favorite reads from this year have been [[Winners Take All]], [[Code]], and [[A Desolation Called Peace]].

I'm slowly trying to chip away at the [[Hugo Award Winners]] for best novel.
## playing
I'm playing [[CorgiSpace]], [[Slice & Dice]], and [[Mechabellum]].

I'm getting ready for my friends' end of the year [GOTY discussions](https://ryankubik.com/blog/2024-what-i-played). I'm looking forward to playing more over the holidays. These are some I'm interested in checking out.
- [[Despelote]]
- [[Consume Me]]
- [[Skin Deep]]
- [[s.p.l.i.t.]]
- [[The Drifter]]
- [[La Mulana]]
- [[Angeline Era]]

I've also been getting back into [[Magic the Gathering]] Commander recently. I've just been using old decks, but considering picking up some new cards again.
## making
I'm working on this website off and on. Most recently, I added this notes site as a way to publish writing more often.

I'm trying to write about more honest things. I've tended to publish more "safe" posts. I don't think this gets me what I want to get from writing.

I'm trying to finish making more games. I'm currently working on a successor to [[Terminal Escape]] and trying to be distracted less by new projects.
## thinking about
- Capitalism is weird (euphemism)
- Working is weird
- I like writing software
- I like making games
