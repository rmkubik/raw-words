title: Raw Words
---

Raw words are written here. I wanted to publish more writing. I take plenty of notes that seem like they'd be good posts, but I never "finished" them for publication. I've decided to give up "finishing" the notes I wrote as posts and publish them here, raw, instead.

I need to tag a note as `#public` in Obsidian for it to be published here. My notes are private by default. That feels safer to me since I use them as an emotional outlet too.

Some starting topics:
