title: Raw Words

These words are raw. I want to publish more writing. I've gotten into a good habit of writing in my notes, but I never "finish" any of it for publication. I've decided to give up "finishing" the notes I wrote as posts and publish them here, raw, instead.

This site is built with Quartz and shows all notes that I've tagged as `#public`. This is a pretty small subset of my notes right now, but I'm excited to see how it grows.

There's not really any rhyme or reason to this site yet, but you can at least see what I'm up to [[now]].
