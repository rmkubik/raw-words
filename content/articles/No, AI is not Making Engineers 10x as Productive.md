- https://colton.dev/blog/curing-your-ai-10x-engineer-imposter-syndrome/

I liked this read.

The gist was:
- AI tooling just doesn't take that much time to onboard onto and learn how to use. The author says a competent engineer should work out how to use it better in like 2 weeks time.
- 10x is a WHOLE lot more than people intuitively think it is, that's doing as much in a 1.5 weeks as you used to do in a whole quarter.
- Maybe AI does speed up the code generation aspect - do you actually think every other _human_ step in the process has been sped up x10 times? Code review, waiting for reviewer to respond to comments, planning, writing tickets, etc. I do not.
