1. We don't know anything
2. People are different
3. We like to simplify

Try to share experience instead of opinions. Our opinions are formed on a lot of bad data impulsively. One event one time can make you generalize about a wide swath of similar seeming things with no real relation.

Tom (the author) suggests we should not share our opinions. I don't think I agree there. But I do like the idea of sharing our experiences more. I think we probably shouldn't avoid disclosing opinions and positions so we can't be wrong. I do think arguing about them isn't particularly helpful. I do think stating a position in an argument backs you into a weird defensive corner. So, I suppose in arguments I do agree stating a position can be pretty counterproductive.
