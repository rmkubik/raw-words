- Two important quotes from the paper:
	- “We have to challenge the assumptions that natural languages would simplify work.”
	- “The virtue of formal texts is that their manipulation, in order to be legitimate, need to satisfy only a few simple rules; they are, when you come to think of it, an amazingly effective tool for ruling out all sorts of nonsense that, when we use our native tongues, are almost impossible to avoid.”
- The gist as I understand it is, natural language is ambiguous. We need code to specify formally what outputs we want.
