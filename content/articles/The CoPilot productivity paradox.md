> CoPilot is pretty good at taking things that are already pretty fast, such as monotonous code transformations like mapping an object to a SQL statement, and then making that even faster.

> The position I’m leaning toward is that bolting on LLM suggestions as a drop-in replacement for classic IDE-suggestions is a bad idea that doesn’t make good use of neither the LLM’s capabilities nor the programmers'.

> As an experienced programmer, you can get most of the benefits and none of the drawbacks from CoPilot by putting in the effort to learn to type faster, or to make better use of the editor with e.g. vim motions

The gist of this article was echoing how I felt. Turning off autocompletion via copilot feels better. The LLMs are better about processing a bunch of information and giving you info to aid your decision process. They're not really that helpful to speed up the act of typing.
