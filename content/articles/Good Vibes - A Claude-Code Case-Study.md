This is a big article someone wrote about using Claude to make a sizeable app.

I think this might be the way to go to try and get an understanding of the people who are INTO "vibing". 

I need to read more, but the initial highlight seems to be "do a whole heck of a lot of planning".

He also uses a "golf" metaphor for agentic stuff. The AI is good at hitting big swings and putting. If your first attempt doesn't get you within putting distance of the hole, start over, don't keep hitting. (Metaphor is a little weird, but I get it.)
