This is a series by the guy who wrote [[Blood in the Machine]]. He is getting workers impacted by AI stuff in their work to tell their stories.

This particular issue is about tech workers. The article doesn't really have that much info like I was hoping it might.

There's definitely some corroboration of feelings I'm having in there. But, it's nothing particular encouraging to me.
