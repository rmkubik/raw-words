I read this post a few days ago and went down a huge rabbit hole. Really loved this post.

I don't think I have the time and energy to summarize this post right now.

But there's a bunch of info here about alternatives to search engines and alternative monetization options.

Lots of great links to a ton of interesting stuff on the web too. Good personal blogs and other stuff.

Good info for:
- [[How can you pay for a website without ads? (monetization)]]
- [[Collaborative or cooperative search engine and index]]
